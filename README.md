### Task Description : A Comprehensive Analysis for Ecological Data integration using Mixed-Resolution Imagery
We cannot preserve what we cannot measure. There is an urgent need to understand the location, health, and ecological value of nature and biodiversity, and ensure these metrics are reflected in policy, finance, and decision-making. Machine learning can play a significant role in responding to this critical call for action and can accelerate the conservation and sustainable use of our natural world. However, as the availability of remote sensing imagery and computing power increases exponentially, efficiently integrating many different temporal and spatial resolution data sources become more and more a challenge.

This semester project aims to develop a theoretical framework for ecological data integration of mixed-resolution imagery through (1) a comprehensive analysis of existing data integration methodology and (2) developing well-defined abstractions that could provide potential guarantees for accuracy without losing the uncertainty of mixed resolution.

The semester project will entail a literature review of current state-of-the-art data integration, a mid-term presentation on the experimental setup, and, lastly, a semester project report summarizing the findings.
